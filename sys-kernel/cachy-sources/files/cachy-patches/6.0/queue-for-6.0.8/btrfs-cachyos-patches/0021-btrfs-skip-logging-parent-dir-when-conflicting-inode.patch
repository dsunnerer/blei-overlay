Subject: [PATCH 21/32] btrfs: skip logging parent dir when conflicting inode
 is not a dir

When we find a conflicting inode (an inode that had the same name and
parent directory as the inode we are logging now) that was deleted in the
current transaction, we always end up logging its parent directory.

This is to deal with the case where the conflicting inode corresponds to
a deleted subvolume/snapshot or a directory that had subvolumes/snapshots
(or some subdirectory inside it had subvolumes/snapshots, etc), because
we can't deal with dropping subvolumes/snapshots during log replay. So
if we log the parent directory, and if we are dealing with these special
cases, then we fallback to a transaction commit when logging the parent,
because its last_unlink_trans will match the current transaction (which
gets set and propagated when a subvolume/snapshot is deleted).

This change skips the logging of the parent directory when the conflicting
inode is not a directory (or a subvolume/snapshot). This is ok because in
this case logging the current inode is enough to trigger an unlink of the
conflicting inode during log replay.

So for a case like this:

  $ mkdir /mnt/dir
  $ echo -n "first foo data" > /mnt/dir/foo

  $ sync

  $ rm -f /mnt/dir/foo
  $ echo -n "second foo data" > /mnt/dir/foo
  $ xfs_io -c "fsync" /mnt/dir/foo

We avoid logging parent directory "dir" when logging the new file "foo".
In other cases it avoids falling back to a transaction commit, when the
parent directory has a last_unlink_trans value that matches the current
transaction, due to moving a file from it to some other directory.

This is a case that happens frequently with dbench for example, where a
new file that has the name/parent of another file that was deleted in the
current transaction, is fsynced.
